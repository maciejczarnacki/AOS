## Astromaniac Optical Simulator


Welcome to the page dedicated to the AOS program. First, let's ask ourselves what AOS is. 
This is a tool for generating Ronchi simulation images and then comparing them to the actual Ronchi images of the telescope under test. 
The program enables approximate quantitative determination of the wavefront error and the Strehl coefficient for the tested optics.

The page is divided into several parts:
- [Download page](./download.md)
- [How to install AOS](./installation.md)
- First steps with AOS
- How it really works

If you feel the need to support the development of this interesting tool, you can support the author with any donation via [PayPal]().
The donation is not obligatory and AOS is free.
